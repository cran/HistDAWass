Description: In the framework of Symbolic Data Analysis, a relatively new
    approach to the statistical analysis of multi-valued data, we consider
    histogram-valued data, i.e., data described by univariate histograms. The
    methods and the basic statistics for histogram-valued data are mainly based
    on the L2 Wasserstein metric between distributions, i.e., a Euclidean metric
    between quantile functions. The package contains unsupervised classification
    techniques, least square regression and tools for histogram-valued data and for
    histogram time series.
